(* The following module offers a facility for translating names to de Bruijn
   indices. It is parameterized over the type of names, which must come with
   a comparison function, so as to allow an efficient implementation of maps. *)

  module M =
    Map.Make(N)

  (* For efficiency reasons, we must work internally with de Bruijn levels,
     as opposed to de Bruijn indices, and perform the conversion to an index
     at the last moment. *)
  
  type env = {
    (* A map of every name to a de Bruijn level. *)
    map:     int M.t;
    (* The current de Bruijn level. It is equal to the level of the most
       recently bound name. Its absolute value is irrelevant. *)
    current: int;
  }

  (* The empty environment. *)

  let empty =
    { map = M.empty; current = 0 }

  (* [lookup env x] translates the name [x] to a de Bruijn index. The
     environment [env] must have been previously extended with [x],
     otherwise [Unbound x] is raised. *)

  exception Unbound of N.t

  let lookup { map; current } x =
    (* Looking up the map produces a de Bruijn level, which we
       convert to a de Bruijn index by subtracting it from the
       current level. *)

      current - M.find x map
    with Not_found ->
      raise (Unbound x)

  (* [extend env x] extends the environment with a new binding of the
     name [x], producing a new environment. Any previous bindings of
     this name are shadowed. *)

  let extend { map; current } x =
    let current = current + 1 in
    let map = M.add x current map in
    { map; current }

  (* [slide env x] extends the environment with a new binding of the
     name [x], producing a new environment. Any previous bindings of
     this name are shadowed. In contrast with [extend env x], instead
     of mapping [x] to a distinct index, [slide env x] maps [x] to the
     same index as the last introduced name. This exotic function can
     be useful, e.g., when mapping term variables to type indices. *)

  let slide { map; current } x =
    (* Do not increment [current]. Thus, [x] receives the de Bruijn
       index 0, as in [extend], but the indices of the previous
       variables are not shifted up. *)
    let map = M.add x current map in
    { map; current }

  (* [bump env] skips an index, i.e., it shifts the range of the environment
     [env] up by one. This exotic function can be useful, e.g., when mapping
     term variables to type indices.  Note that [extend env x] is equivalent
     to [slide (bump env) x]. *)

(* This signature defines the functions that we need in order to be able
   to implement binding representations on top of some syntax. *)

(* The signatures that follow mention two types [v] and [t]. Think of them as
   ``values'' and ``terms'', where the syntax of terms supports substitution
   of values for variables. They can be the same type, of course. They are
   parameterized over a representation of variables ['var] and a
   representation of binders ['binder]. *)

  type ('var, 'binder) v
  type ('var, 'binder) t

  (* [traverse lookup extend env t] can be thought of, roughly, as the result of
     applying the substitution [lookup env] to the term [t] in a
     capture-avoiding manner. The function [lookup], when supplied with a
     suitable environment, maps variables to values. The function [extend]
     updates the environment when a binder is crossed; it returns a pair of
     the updated environment and a new binder. The parameter [env] is the
     initial environment. *)

(* A renaming function, [map], is defined in terms of [var] and [traverse].
   It is analogous to [traverse], except that its argument [lookup] has type
   ['env -> 'var1 -> 'var2]. *)
